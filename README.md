# Mage Quest_2d

Welcome to Mage Quest_2D my second Java game project!

Thanks to www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow for making a great beginners tutorial which allowed me to start initially.  
I took some inspiration from his implementation but started to develop my own ideas early on. That said for example the pathfinding is more heavily copied and only a modified a bit.  


## FEATURES:  
### Multiplayer:  
You can start the same programm twice on the same PC (localhost) or different PC's ( in the same network) and play together!  
The host need to press c + m (ingame) and the client needs to input the hosts local IP (eg. 192.168.x.xx) and the press c + f.  
I used java sockets with a static port (60069).  
I didnt yet update it to work correctly with the newest pathfinding updates.  
 
## Movement:

W - UP  
A - LEFT  
S - DOWN  
D - RIGHT  

## Combat:

Left Mouse Button - Primary Fire (1 Damage)  
Right Mouse Button - Secondary Fire (5 Damage)  
1 - Ability 1 (5 Damage)  
N - opens talent window (stub for now)  
## Graphics:  

Most of the "Pixel Art" i made myself, i did take inspiration from @RyiSnow's textures and games like HeroSiege.  


## Roadmap:  

Level system  
skills / skill pane  
dropped items  
inventory   
npcs / bartering
