GameSave.sqlite is your save game. Don't delete it, you won't ever need to replace it when updating.  
DataBase.sqlite should be updated regularly to access the newest items etc.

🔧 𝕊𝕦𝕡𝕡𝕠𝕣𝕥 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝔹𝕦𝕘𝕣𝕖𝕡𝕠𝕣𝕥𝕤:

When you encounter a bug, please make a new thread in the bug report forum and I will look work on it.  
Just post the error.log that is in your installation directory and include a small description.

Also, if you happen to lose items from bugs you can post there, and I'll do my best to replace them.
