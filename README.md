# Bit_Adventure_2D

Welcome to Bit_Adventure_2D my second Java game project!

Thanks to www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow for making a great beginners tutorial which allowed me to start initially.  
I took some inspiration from his implementation but started to develop my own ideas early on. That said for example the pathfinding is more heavily copied and only a modified a bit.  


## FEATURES:  
### Multiplayer:  
You can start the same programm twice on the same pc or different PC's ( in the same network) and play together!  
The host need to press c + m (ingame) and the client needs to input the hosts local IP (eg. 192.168.x.xx) and the press c + f.  
I used java sockets with a static port (60069).  
I didnt yet update it to work correctly with the newest pathfinding updates.
