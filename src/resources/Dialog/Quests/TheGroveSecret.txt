Well, *chuckles* a lot of people want to get in. That's why we sell tickets. Do you have one? If not you can buy one right now ... with a small fee added on top for short notice of course.
Splendid! You may proceed right through. Once you step foot on the isle, you'll receive a warm introduction to everything we have to offer. And hey, *smiles* don't forget to smile: Welcome to The Grove!
Iam afraid I can't help you. Money doesn't grow on tree's now does it, neither do tickets... If you would be so kind to step away, please.


Uhh, *breaths lightly* hey - come here. Share my dying moment with me. I have a ticket if this motivates you.
Listen, there's something here, something *coughs* something is wrong with this place. Dont be fooled by its idyllic appearance.
There's a dark aura, and it feeds on you. I can't explain how but look at me: I've been here for a week now and gotten weaker every day.
Like something is sucking the soul right from you. Last night it made me go here, I was to weak to resist it. But I guess lucky for me its a dead end here, see.
But behind those rocks lies a dark place iam certain. For me it's too late to do anything, I realized it too late - here take my ticket. Get to the bottom of it. I beg you, let my death be not in vein! uhh....
