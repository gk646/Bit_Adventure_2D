Ah, you look like someone who's been through a lot. Want to hear a joke? Why did the necromancer go to the bar? To raise a few spirits!
Oh, hello there. Have you seen my cow? She wandered off again. I swear, if it's not demons attacking, it's my cow running away.
I heard that the mayor is secretly a demon in disguise. You didn't hear it from me, though.
You adventurers are all the same - always looking for the next big challenge. Why can't you just be happy with what you have?
I wish I had your courage, going out there and fighting monsters like it's no big deal. Me, I'm happy just hiding in my basement.
Have you heard about the new health potions? They're made from fresh unicorn tears! I don't know about you, but I think we should start a Save the Unicorns movement instead.
I saw the witch doctor making a voodoo doll of the mayor. I don't think he likes him very much. But hey, who am I to judge? We all have our hobbies.
