Ah, hello there. 'Tis a surprise to see you here!
You look as if you just escaped from the woods. Was it something that chased you, perhaps?
You have asked me for guidance in your new journey, and I shall be happy to provide it.
First and foremost, you must learn the basics of moving around in this world. We shall use the WASD keys on your keyboard to do so.
Press the W key to move forward, the S key to move backward, the A key to move left, and the D key to move right.
Follow me!
Now that you have mastered the basics of movement, it is time to learn the basics of combat.
Press LEFT MOUSE button to shoot!
Watch out there are coming!
Kill the monsters!
Kill the monsters!
Well done, adventurer!
In this treacherous world, one must always be mindful of their surroundings and wary of their enemies.
Gather whatever weapons and armor you can find, and use them to fight off those who wish to do you harm.
Let me clear the path!
Let see where this goes...
Hmm a door? You could help me out, see if you can find anything down these paths here that might help us.
It might be dangerous and you already helped me out so you earned a little reward that should come in handy for you.
Switch through the option with Q and choose with F!
Did you find something? Come back if you have, and hurry we aint got all day...
Ahh nice, that should help very well. *Drinks the whole bottle of booze*
Ehm, yes where were we... Right, finding the way out of here. Lets if I can open that aswell...
There we go... Hmm, this looks like a courtyard of an old ruin. I bet there's something interesting inside.
You know the drill, I cant keep up with a young lad like you. Go ahead but watch out, its uncomfortably eerie here.
Go ahead, don't be shy. Report back if you found something useful ill lie low outside here.
You have slain the what?! I don't even want to know... Anyway good job on that lets see if that really opened as you say.
And finally, do not fear the unknown. As you venture forth on your journey, you will encounter many mysterious creatures and places.
Approach them with courage, and you may just find something valuable in the process!
Fare thee well, young one! May your journey be filled with success and adventure!
