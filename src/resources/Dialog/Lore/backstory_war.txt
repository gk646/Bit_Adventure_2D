In the days of old, when time and history had not yet been recorded, a great battle arose between the forces of Light and Darkness. For an eternity, the raged on with neither side able to gain a decisive victory. Thus, The Light and The Darkness agreed that a pact should be made in order to maintain the balance between the two sides, never to act upon the worlds in any way to gain an advantage.
And so the pact between the Light and Darkness was sealed and the balance of power between the two sides has been preserved. But this pact had a heavy price, for the forces of Darkness were able to gain more and more strength while the forces of Light were restrained. This is because of the inherent connection between humanity and the Darkness that allows evil to be more easily accepted than goodness. Thus, the evil creatures of the Darkness have spread throughout the world, ravaging and destroying, while the Light could do nothing to protect its people.
The world is now in a state of disarray, and the balance of power between the two sides has never been more precarious.
