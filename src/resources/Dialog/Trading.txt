You're in luck, I've got the finest gear this side of the demon realm!
Well, well, well, if it isn't my favorite customer. What can I do for you today?
A pleasure to see you again! Here's what I've got for you today.
Looking to trade, eh? Well, you've come to the right place.
Ah, a new customer. Welcome to my humble shop. What can I offer you?
Hello there, adventurer. What treasures can I provide for you today?
Oh joy, it's you again. I was beginning to think my wares didn't interest you anymore!
Hey there, what can I do for you today? Need some gear to take on the hordes of hell?
Greetings, traveler! You've come to the right place if you're looking for quality goods at reasonable prices.
Well, well, well, what have we here? Another victim... I mean, customer! What can I get for you?
Herbs, schmerbs. What can I do for you today?
Got any schmeckles to spare? I sure hope so...
It's you again! I was hoping to never see your face again... just kidding, I'm always happy to do business with you.
I used to be an adventurer like you, until I took a demon arrow to the knee. Now I just sell weapons to people like you who want to take arrows to the knee.
