Thank you, ill catch you up on what happened, but don't judge me!
You see, I recently "sold" a necklace. Well, I had some debts to pay off and the only valuable thing I have is an old magical necklace.
But it's a longtime family heirloom, I just couldn't bring myself to sell it. So I foolishly made a fake version and sold it to a traveler who passed through here.
It seemed like a good idea at first, but I realized too late that he wasn't just any ordinary traveler. She was an adventurer, like yourself, and now I'm worried she might catch on to the lie.
If she got in danger and die because of the useless necklace... But if you tell him the lie he might come back and threaten me!
You have to find him, and help me out of my situation.
I cant pay much but ill find something iam sure. Will you help me?
I see how it is. You're not willing to help out a fellow traveler in need. I thought you were different, but I guess I was wrong.
I was somehow convinced you would help me after I saw you...
She headed east, so I've marked it on your map. Make sure she doesn't come back here and ruin everything, please!

You came right on time, who ever you might be?! You're not here to rob me or beat me to it?
Sure ill tell YOU?... ... Watch out!                          !
Arrgh, those little pesky mushroom thingys. Hate em. So, yeah bla bla you helped me. Don't make me say it!
*Sigh*, okay. You can come along. I could definitely use the help with how dangerous everything got recently...
So, to stop being so secretive about this. I got a tip, about a hidden cave entrance leading to the mountain top. What will we find there? I hope treasure and riches, of course.
I think down here is the right path. I'll give you a sec to look around if you want. Man, speaking of, looks like these mushrooms got you bad. Here a little something for helping me fight them off.
Are you ready to go?
Let's go, eh, adventuring! ... ... Hey dont judge me on my oneliners!
Four statues and in such a shape, I doubt that's a coincidence. Maybe some kind of puzzle, but not what I came here to do. I'll wait over at the stairs if you wanna look around.























































What are you saying? That I bought shit and *takes a closer look* ... dont know what quality... woah, your right!
I paid a sum for this! Hmm, didn't expect to meet cutthroats in this village. On the other hand this weird mayor should have given it away...
Iam going back there ill demand an explanation and the real necklace, if there is one! Thanks for telling me, meet me there if you want.
