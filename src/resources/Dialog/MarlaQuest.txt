Thank you, ill catch you up on what happened, but don't judge me!
You see, I recently "sold" a necklace. Well, I had some debts to pay off and the only valuable thing I have is an old magical necklace.
But it's a longtime family heirloom, I just couldn't bring myself to sell it. So I foolishly made a fake version and sold it to a traveler who passed through here.
It seemed like a good idea at first, but I realized too late that he wasn't just any ordinary traveler. She was an adventurer, like yourself, and now I'm worried she might catch on to the lie.
If she got in danger and die because of the useless necklace... But if you tell him the lie he might come back and threaten me!
You have to find him, and help me out of my situation.
I cant pay much but ill find something iam sure. Will you help me?
I see how it is. You're not willing to help out a fellow traveler in need. I thought you were different, but I guess I was wrong.
I was somehow convinced you would help me after I saw you...
She headed east, so I've marked it on your map. Make sure she doesn't come back here and ruin everything, please!












marla sold a fake necklace because she lost the real one ,in order to pay off a debt. but the buyer is a adventuere aswell and could see that its fake. also the buyer said he wants to search around the area for treasure and might stumble upon the real necklace. She wants you to help her find the real necklace so she's safe in case he returns or can sell it.

As you search for the necklace, you come across the person who bought the fakenecklace from Marla. They tell you the truth about the situation, and ask that you don't reveal their role in the transaction. You must then decide whether to keep Marla's secret and help her pass off the fake necklace as the real one, or confront her with the truth and risk damaging her reputation and possibly causing her to turn on you.

When you return the fake necklace to Marla, she is overjoyed, and thanks you profusely for your help. But if you chose to confront her, she may become angry or refuse to provide you with further assistance. Or, if you kept her secret and someone else found out the truth, you may face consequences down the line.
