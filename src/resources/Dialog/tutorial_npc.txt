Ah, hello there. 'Tis a surprise to see you here!
You look as if you just escaped from the woods. Was it something that chased you, perhaps?
You have asked me for guidance in your new journey, and I shall be happy to provide it.
First and foremost, you must learn the basics of moving around in this world. We shall use the WASD keys on your keyboard to do so.
Press the W key to move forward, the S key to move backward, the A key to move left, and the D key to move right.
Follow me!
Now that you have mastered the basics of movement, it is time to learn the basics of combat.
Press LEFT MOUSE button to shoot!
Watch out there are coming!
Kill the monsters!
Kill the monsters!
Good job!
In this world, you must pay heed to your environment and be watchful of your enemies.
Gather whatever weapons and armor you can find, and use them to fight off those who wish to do you harm.
Let me open this for you!
Let see where this goes...
Another door?! You could help me out, see if you can find anything down these paths here that might help us.
Watch out, it might be dangerous!
Did you find something?
And finally, do not fear the unknown. As you venture forth on your journey, you will encounter many mysterious creatures and places.
Approach them with courage, and you may just find something valuable in the process!
Fare thee well, young one! May your journey be filled with success and adventure!
